# Introduction

It is a small tool to convert encoding, which I wrote long long time ago.

It's useful to me and someone may need it too, so I extract it from old code repo and build it to a standalone tool.

Please star it if you like it :)

You can raise issue to me if you want new functions.

Thanks,
